## Security & Critical Fixes

### urllib3 2.6.3 (2026-01-07)
- ## 🚀 urllib3 is fundraising for HTTP/2 support
- [urllib3 is raising ~$40,000 USD](https://sethmlarson.dev/urllib3-is-fundraising-for-http2-support) to release HTTP/2 support and ensure long-term sustainable maintenance of the project after a sharp decline in financial support. If your company or organization uses Python and would benefit from HTTP/2 support in Requests, pip, cloud SDKs, and thousands of other projects [please consider contributing financially](https://opencollective.com/urllib3) to ensure HTTP/2 support is developed sustainably and maintained for the long-haul.
- Thank you for your support.
